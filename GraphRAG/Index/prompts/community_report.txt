# Goal
Write a comprehensive assessment report of a community taking on the role of a 您提供的信息似乎涉及一个教育技术平台（可能是“小雅”）的使用说明和功能介绍。为了更清晰地回答您的问题或提供帮助，请明确以下几点：

1. 您需要了解哪个具体方面的操作指南？例如：如何设置账号、发布任务给学生、进行课堂互动等。
2. 是否有特定的功能您想要深入了解，比如“逐题互动”、“抢答环节”或者“计分项”的详细使用方法？
3. 如果是遇到问题，能否描述一下遇到了什么困难或错误信息？

根据您的具体需求，我可以提供更详细的指导。. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities and relationships.

# Report Structure
The report should include the following sections:
- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant points associated with its entities.
- REPORT RATING: 从您的描述来看，您似乎在讨论一个教育技术平台（如小雅）的功能和使用方法。这个平台提供了丰富的教学工具，包括任务发布、课堂互动、学生管理等功能，旨在帮助教师更有效地进行课堂教学和评估学生的学业表现。下面是对几个关键功能的简要总结：

1. **账号设置**：用户可以在此修改个人信息，例如头像、昵称等，并且能够绑定多种账户形式（如手机、邮箱、微信、QQ），以方便登录。

2. **计分项与成绩管理**：教师可以根据教学需求自定义各种学习活动的评分标准和权重。这些活动包括自主观看视频、作业提交、课堂练习、测验、问卷调查等。此外，还可以通过新增域外成绩来导入其他系统或线下产生的成绩单，并设置相应的总分值。

3. **课堂互动**：支持全卷显示与逐题互动两种答题模式，教师可以实时查看学生的参与情况和答案结果。同时，平台还提供了抢答、随机选人提问等功能，以增加课堂的互动性和趣味性。

4. **任务发布与管理**：在备授课环节中，教师能够创建并分配不同类型的学习任务给学生，如自主观看视频等，并设置具体的开始结束时间及参与对象（全体或特定班级/小组）。

5. **成绩计算与展示**：系统会根据教师设定的各项活动分值自动累加总分和占比。对于学习时长、课堂表现等难以直接量化的指标，则通过每小时分值相加的方式进行评估，超过预设的总分值则按该上限计分。

综上所述，这个平台旨在为教育工作者提供一个全面而灵活的教学管理工具，以促进更高效和个性化的教学实践。
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format. Don't use any unnecessary escape sequences. The output should be a single JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads.
    {
        "title": "<report_title>",
        "summary": "<executive_summary>",
        "rating": <threat_severity_rating>,

        "findings": "[{"summary":"<insight_1_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_1_explanation"}, {"summary":"<insight_2_summary>", "explanation": "<insight_2_explanation"}]"
    }

# Grounding Rules
After each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.
Each paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities. All paragraphs must have these references at the start and end. Use "NONE" if there are no related roles or records. Everything should be in Chinese.

Example paragraph with references added:
This is a paragraph of the output text [records: Entities (1, 2, 3), Claims (2, 5), Relationships (10, 12)]
